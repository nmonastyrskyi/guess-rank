## Description
Hi there! Welcome to my assignment for the Guess the Rank game.

## Game Rules
1. You'll be presented with a poker hand
     - 5 cards are dealt from a standard 52-card deck
     - Each rank has an equal chance of appearing
2. Your goal is to guess the correct ranking of the hand
     - The ranking can be anything from a high card to a royal flush
3. Each correct guess earns you 1 point and adds a 5 second bonus to the timer
4. Each incorrect guess subtracts 5 seconds from the timer
5. The game continues until the timer runs out
6. Try to achieve the highest score possible!

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/nmonastyrskyi/guess-rank.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd guess-rank
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    pnpm install
    ```
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following API keys:
    - `VITE_API_NINJA_KEY` - API Ninja API key
      - You can get the API key by registering at [API Ninja](https://api-ninjas.com/)
    - `VITE_OPEN_AI_KEY` - OpenAI API URL
      - You can get the API URL by registering at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)
    ```env
    VITE_API_NINJA_KEY=your_api_ninja_key
    VITE_OPEN_AI_KEY=your_open_ai_key
    ```
> [!IMPORTANT]
If you have any issues with the API keys, please let me know, I can provide you with the keys.

5. Start the development server:
    ```sh
    pnpm dev
    ```
